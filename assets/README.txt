Place your avatar image here and name it exactly `avatar.jpg`.

Recommended: 600×600 (square) or larger. The image will be cropped to a circular avatar.

Place your navbar logo image here and name it exactly `NK.png`.

Recommended: 120×120 (square) or 80×80 (either works). Preferably use a PNG with a transparent background.

If you want me to add the logo for you, upload it and tell me and I will place it in `assets` and update the HTML. I can also embed the logo directly into the HTML as a data-URL if you prefer.
